// things to note here:
// - vivian and kevin were handwritten, all were generated by chatgpt 4.1
//   with vivian and kevin as examples
// - we intentionally do not put their hobbies in the system prompt
//   we want to see what the llm's can do!!
//   (you could probably get crazy good responses from this though, future feature?)
// - they all live in america because small languages models are stupid
//   and randomly speak different languages (even when told only speak english)

// All girls and boys are exported in 2 arrays at the bottom.
